# Draw YOLO boxes
Draw bounding boxes on original images based on yolo format annotation. It can help you checking the correctness of annotation and extract the images with wrong boxes. You can use [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/) to re-annotate them.

## Usage

### Draw bounding boxes
1. Put all of your raw images in `./raw_images/` folder.
2. Put all of your annotation files(YOLO format txt) in `./labels/` folder.
3. Write your class information into **classes.txt**.
4. Run `python draw_box.py` in your terminal.

Now you have the images with bounding boxes in the `./save_image/` folder.

### Extract the corresponding raw images 
1. Put the images with incorrect boxes into `./wrong/` folder.
2. Clean up `./save_image/` folder.
3. Run `python get_origin_image.py` in your terminal.
 
Now you have the raw images which were annotated incorrectly in the `./save_image/` folder.
